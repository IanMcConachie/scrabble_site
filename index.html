  <h2 class="sub-title">Introduction</h2>
  <p class="norm-text">
    We’ve all been there: it’s a cold winter day and we’re with friends or family, huddled around the board, shielding our letters and plotting our next move. Maybe you're starting to get frustrated because your aunt is taking way too long with her turn–then she finally puts down a word. But is that a word? Or put differently is it a Scrabble word?
    <br>
    <br>
    Everyone who has played the popular word game Scrabble knows of the all-important word challenge–the game mechanic that has spawned countless family debates centered around rulebooks and dictionary references. There are intricacies to what counts as a word in the game of Scrabble. For instance, abbreviations do not count and neither do words that require hyphens, apostrophes, or capital letters. Words in languages other than English will not get you points in the game unless they “have been absorbed into the English language,” as stated in the official rules from Mattel.<sup><a href="#refs-id" class="ref-tag">8</a></sup> However, what happens if a player puts down a word that everyone recognizes, but is taboo in the English language?
    <br>
    <br>
    For most games at home, this issue is avoided by simply reading the room–you wouldn’t play COCK (included because of its definition related to roosters) in a game with your 90 year old grandmother, even if it was “technically allowed.” However, in the niche world of professional Scrabble things get a little more complicated. When politeness and civil debate fall short of resolving these questions the responsibility is placed on a handful of player associations and corporations to decide what counts as a word in Scrabble. This has led to a long and heated debate revolving around discrimination, censorship, free speech, and semantics. Scrabble may just be a game, but it is a game of language--and wherever there is language, there is power.
    <br>
    <br>
    This site takes a look at the banning of words in Scrabble and the differing opinions that surround the issue. Scrabble is available in dozens of languages, but here we will focus on the English versions of the game specifically. Please note that the content below will discuss topics of hate speech that may be sensitive to some readers. I have done my best to censor particularly offensive terms for the sake of readers' comfort, but since everyone has different reactions to language I apologize for any content that causes offense.

  <h2 class="sub-title">Types of Banned Words</h2>
  <div class="banned-table">
  <div class="row banned-row">
    <div class="col">
      <h3 class="banned-title">Slurs</h3>
      <p class="banned-blurb">
        This category is often central in the debate over the inclusion of words in official Scrabble dictionaries. More recent banning campaigns have often started due to the outrage of the N word being included in official Scrabble word lists. As one of the most hateful and historically significant slurs in American English, the idea of playing it in a crossword game is often enough to convince regulatory bodies to take a second look at what should "count" in the game. The debate becomes even trickier when definitions are included in dictionaries. For instance, the push to reexamine Scrabble word lists in the early 90s is credited to Judith Grad, a Virginian art gallery owner, who was appalled to find JEW included in the OSPD with the definition “to bargain with–an offensive term.”<sup><a href="#refs-id" class="ref-tag">3</a></sup> The definition of JEW that refers to people who practice Judaism is excluded from all Scrabble dictionaries because it is a proper noun. 
      </p>

      <p class="banned-blurb">
        Within this debate there is also the issue of which slurs get removed and which ones remain. In Australia, Indigenous activists pointed out that although many racially charged words originating in the US and the UK were removed, several slurs directed towards the Indigenous Peoples of Australia remained. In the the North American NWL dictionary, words such as REDNECK and WHITIES were removed, but R*****N (an offensive term used to refer to Native Americans) made it to the new edition unscathed. Even more issues come up when words have multiple meanings with one or more being a slur. The term F****T has a long history as anti-LGBTQ+ hate speech, but can also be used to refer to cigarettes or a bundle of sticks. Without context (something that is lacking in Scrabble) it is difficult to classify the use of this word as either offensive or benign. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <h3 class="banned-title">Vulgar Words</h3>
      <p class="banned-blurb">
        While slurs--especially ethnic and racial slurs--often take center stage in debates about the banning of words in Scrabble dictionaries, word removals usually include a wide variety of vocabulary considered inappropriate in polite conversation. This includes words that are more commonly considered to be taboo such as FUCK, but also ones that are considerably more tame including PEEING and TURD which were both removed from the OSPD (all three remain in the NWL). The concept of vulgar, like slurs, becomes more complicated when definitions are included in word lists. For example: ASS, COCK, and PUSSY are all included in all dictionaries because they have less offensive definitions associated with them in addition to their "vulgar" meanings. In terms of "vulgarity" we also see more clearly the reasons for having different dictionaries for different variations of English. The swear word BLOODY is generally considered perfectly palatable to Americans, while people in the UK or Australia often use C**T without intending invoking the harsh connotation that word carries in the States.
      </p>
      <h3 class="banned-title">Other Words</h3>
      <p class="banned-blurb">
        Due to push-back from the professional Scrabble community, both the CWL and NWL often stick to the other two categories when deciding what terms are too offensive to be included. However, the OSPD often removes other types of words in a similar fashion to the way words are added to the collection. Because it is meant for recreational play, removing words not as universally offensive such as BALDY doesn't cause as much backlash. Similarly, removing words that are considered "outdated" is more accepted because friendly games generally don't have to have extremely verbose and formalized rules around fair play.

          Most supporters of the ban argue that hateful connotations behind slurs simply have no place in a recreational activity. Before the bans in the early 90s, the Anti-Defamation League accused Hasbro of "literally playing games with hate."<sup><a href="#refs-id" class="ref-tag">3</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li class="resp">
          Proponents of the bans have said that by removing offensive words, Scrabble is made more inclusive and contributes towards the game's goal of "bringing people together" in the words of Hasbro.<sup><a href="#refs-id" class="ref-tag">14</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li class="resp">
          It can be argued that words are inextricably linked to their meanings--especially slurs--and therefore it does not matter the context in which they are used.
        </li>
        <li class="resp">
          By bringing together the Scrabble community--both amateurs and professionals--to discuss the banning of words, we address the power of these words. If excluding words was out of the picture, this would effectively fail to acknowledge the hurtful pasts behind some of the slurs included in official Scrabble dictionaries.
        </li>
        <li class="resp">
          Groups of members in the Scrabble player associations threatened to quit if any slurs were not removed from the game.

          Hasbro and Mattel have both been accused of virtue signaling--making a performative gesture to seem moral without actually taking any action to address the issues they claim to care about.
        </li>
        <li class="resp">
          Those who oppose the bans across the board often argue that Scrabble is a game about the words, not the meanings behind those words. They argue that in the context of the game the definitions of a word do not matter.
        </li>
        <li class="resp">
          Some players claim that the regulatory bodies in charge of making these changes did not sufficiently consult the professional community before making the changes. They also argue there is not enough transparency and consensus in the deciding what words go and which ones stay.
        </li>
        <li class="resp">
          Outside of the United States, tournament players have labeled bans as the "imposing American values on the world".<sup><a href="#refs-id" class="ref-tag">2</a></sup> The idea being that because many of the banned word movements have began in the United States, they embody American ideals and biases while ignoring the rest of the English-speaking word.

  <!-- Conclusion Section -->
  <h2 class="sub-title">Connection to Language and Power</h2>
  <p class="norm-text">
    What “counts” as a word is a discussion that extends far beyond the cardboard walls of the family’s Scrabble set. The inclusion or exclusion of words from a dictionary always demonstrates the bias of its authors because ultimately no person can fully catalog a system as dynamic and expansive as a language. Every dictionary must make choices about what “counts” and what does not. Scrabble dictionaries are unique because when a word “counts” it counts for points in a game. For some this makes the whole discussion frivolous, but even in the context of board games: words have power.
    <br> 
    <br>
    If you never play Scrabble once, the debates around what terms are officially valid in the game still matter because these word lists are ultimately authorities on the English language. After all, Scrabble dictionaries consistently rank as some of the top-selling dictionaries in the United States.<sup><a href="#refs-id" class="ref-tag">1</a></sup> By discussing offensive language in the game of Scrabble we are forced to confront the impact and divisiveness of these words. It also teaches us to look further into who is making decisions about formalized language and what this means for us as users of a language.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are many questions we can ask ourselves about the events and opinions described above. What does it mean to ban a word? Who decides if a word is vulgar or considered to be a slur? Where is the line between social justice and virtue signaling? How does context affect the right to freedom of speech and debates over censorship? This website does not seek to put forth an answer to any of these questions, but rather to start a conversation.
    <br>
    <br>
    In everyday life, there are few times where the semantics and validity of a word are discussed as passionately as after a challenge has been made in Scrabble. The game encourages us to think critically about our language, so it is only natural that debates would arise about formalized definitions and taboo terms. It may be “just a game” but it has an impact. Scrabble gets us thinking about the words we use, what they mean, and how they affect others. Linguistic power dynamics have far reaching implications in today’s world and Scrabble happens to be a surprisingly accessible and relatable domain to discuss them in. So next time your aunt is taking forever with her turn, think about the words you’ve played, the words that haven’t counted, and what it means when you’re considering challenging her play of ARSE for 8 with a double word score.
